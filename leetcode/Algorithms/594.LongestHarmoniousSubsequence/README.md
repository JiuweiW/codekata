We define a harmonious array is an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** 1.

Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible [subsequences][1].

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
<b>Output:</b> 5
<b>Explanation:</b> The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
</pre>

**Note:** The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.
