Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle
<pre>
[
     [<span style="color:red">2</span>],
    [<span style="color:red">3</span>,4],
   [6,<span style="color:red">5</span>,7],
  [4,<span style="color:red">1</span>,8,3]
]
</pre>
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is `11` (i.e., <span style="color:red">2</span> + <span style="color:red">3</span> + <span style="color:red">5</span> + <span style="color:red">1</span> = 11).

**Note:**

Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(*n*) extra space, where *n* is the total number of rows in the triangle.
