The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
     <span style="color:red">3</span>
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     <span style="color:red">3</span>   <span style="color:red">1</span>
</pre>
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = <span style="color:red">3</span> + <span style="color:red">3</span> + <span style="color:red">1</span> = **7**.

**Example 2:**
<pre>
     3
    / \
   <span style="color:red">4</span>   <span style="color:red">5</span>
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1
</pre>
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = <span style="color:red">4</span> + <span style="color:red">5</span> = **9**.
