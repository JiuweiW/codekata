Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly*** one solution.

**Example:**

<pre>
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[<b>0</b>] + nums[<b>1</b>] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [<b>0</b>, <b>1</b>].
</pre>

**UPDATE (2016/2/13):**

The return format had been changed to **zero-based** indices. Please read the above updated description carefully.
