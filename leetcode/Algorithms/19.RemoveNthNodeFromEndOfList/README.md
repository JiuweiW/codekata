Given a linked list, remove the *n*<sup>th</sup> node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,

<pre>
   Given linked list: <b>1->2->3->4->5</b>, and <b><i>n</i></b> = <b>2</b>.

   After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes <b>1->2->3->5</b>.
</pre>

**Note:**

Given *n* will always be valid.

Try to do this in one pass.
