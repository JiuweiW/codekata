Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

**Example:**
<pre>
<b><i>nums</i></b> = [1, 2, 3]
<b><i>target</i></b> = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is <b><i>7</i></b>.
</pre>
