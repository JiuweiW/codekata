Given a **non-empty** integer array of size *n*, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing *n* - 1 elements by 1.

**Example:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
[1,2,3]

<b>Output:</b>
3

<b>Explanation:</b>
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
</pre>
