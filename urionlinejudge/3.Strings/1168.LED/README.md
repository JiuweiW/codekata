**Input**

The input contains an integer **N, (1 ≤ N ≤ 2000)** corresponding to the number of test cases, followed by **N** lines, each line containing a number <b>(1 ≤ V ≤ 10<sup>100</sup>)</b> corresponding to the value that John wants to set with the leds.

**Output**

For each test case, print one line containing the number of LEDs that John needs to set the desired value, followed by the word "leds".
